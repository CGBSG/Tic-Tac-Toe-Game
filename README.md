# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

## Game Info
 ```text
Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two
players who take turns marking the spaces in a
three-by-three grid with X or O. The purpose of
the game is for players to place their 3 allotted
marks (X or O) in a continuous line, vertically,
horizontally, or diagonally. The game is over
when a player gets a continuous line of 3, or
the 9-square grid is full. Tic-Tac-Toe is a
simple and fun game for 2 players, X and O,
played on a 3x3 grid.
